					<strong>Used on over 4.6 million visits</strong> since we released in August 2015. I killed the off-canvas menu, and simplified the navigation for our mobile users. The result: <strong>increased engagement, but more importantly, conversions</strong>.

						LeagueApps: mobile web updates
					</a>
				</h1>
				<p>
					The LeagueApps platform served <strong>over 16 million views in 2014, and 8 million</strong> of them were on a mobile device. So, we optimized the templates and assets to give their mobile users the best possible experience.

						LeagueApps: email templates
					</a>
				</h1>
				<p>
					In 2014, <strong>LeagueApps sent over 2.5 million</strong> emails. These are all automated, or notification&ndash;based emails, but they contain important information for our customers customers (i.e. the game participants). So, having them look right in all programs was uber important.

						Death to the Modals.
					</a>
				</h1>
				<p>
					Continuing in our updates to mobile web traffic for Tradesy.com, along with our navigation updates, we killed modals* for mobile visitors. Again, as many web sites often do, we used (&amp; still do) modals a lot. Like A LOT. But for our mobile web visitors, it was just a very awkward, unpleasant experience.

				<p>
					Everyone knows that mobile traffic has surpassed desktop traffic; especially when it comes to eCommerce. In 2015, Tradesy.comâ€™s traffic experienced the same pivotal moment in April. Our current website was built like many other websites: responsive to work across all browser widths.

				To me, product design is not about making beautiful things. Effective product design is about creating something that you truly believe in; something human beings will, and want to, use; and making it better and better everyday.
			</p>
			<p class="mantra">
				The word beautiful permeates the digital product world unfortunately; and it does nothing to help me, nor anyone else, derive any significant value about said product.
